    <h2>A step by step walk through to the your first html page</h2>

    <p>
      HTML is shor for Hyper Text Markup Language.Basically,it's the "code"
      behind every webpage- even this one.If you're just beginning to learn
      HTML, let us tell you that it' s a fairly easy task . HTML, without
      styling,can't do anything more than setting a layout,drawing a table, or
      creating frames-but it is handy as it helps you structure the content
      correctly, which is important whwn you sit down to style to your HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
      However simple this might seem,it is a mighty useful tool when it comes to
      full-fledged wed development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML
      coding from your work process-but if you want to be full control of your
      web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this article,we aim to give you the essential HTML building blocks
      that'll help you get up and running.Reading this,you'll be able to
      understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your own good!
    </p>
    <h2>Step One - TAGS</h2>
    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png" />
    <p>
      Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source .A tag
      can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document. Tags
      tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.
    </p>

    <p>Let's look at two types of tags:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>&lt;tag-example-1&gt;I need a closign tag&lt;tag-example-1&gt;</li>
      <li>&lt;tag-example-2&gt;I don't need a cloding tag.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the first example, the sentense is wrapped by two tags.The first one is
      called the opening tag and the second one is closing tag.Everything in
      between is affected by properties of the tag. very commonly used example
      of such tags are&lt;html&gt;,&lt;head&gt;,&lt;body&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;,etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second example tags about loner tags- as in,they don't need a closing
      tag to function.Although it's not required these type of tags are often
      written as <tags /> to make the debugging of code easier Common example of
      such tags are &lt;hr/&gt;- used for horizontal line,&lt;br/&gt;- to break
      the line,etc.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Step Two - HTML,HEAD, and BODY:The three pillars of your document
    </h2>
    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg" />
    <p>
      These tags are essential for any HTML document.They parcel out the
      significant parts of your HTML code.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        &lt;BODY&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt; is palced below your &lt;HEAD&gt; tag, and
        Everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this
        tags.Text,images,links, and pretty much anything you can see in your
        browser live inside this tags
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt; wrap your entire code.Everyting else in your
        HTML document needs to come inside these tags.
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt; includes things like title,style,and
        scripts.Haed is usually present at the top(hah!) just inside
        the&lt;/HTML&gt;tag.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step three -A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document,let's
      proceed with the things that will go inside your&lt;BODY&gt;tag and do
      some magic!
    </p>
    <p>Some basic text formatting tags:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; make your text lool <b>bold</b></li>
      <li>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; makes you write in<i>cursive</i></li>
      <li>&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;<u>underlines</u> what you just wrote</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, this piece of code</p>
    <hr />
    <pre>
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;i&gt; I am italicis ! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;b&gt; I am bold !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;u&gt; And me, well, I' m underlined !&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;

    </pre>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Should produce something like this on your browser:Don't fret too much
      about the &lt;br/&gt;.It's just for breaking the line so that you can
      start from the next line.Enter key does little when it comes to changing
      lines in your HTMl document.
    </p>

    <h4>Tags to help you structure your content:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;br/&gt; breaks the line, making you continue to the next line</li>
      <li>
        &lt;p&gt; stands for paragraph. it divides your content into paragraphs
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i
        >Note: you need to use these tags as spce and enter keys do very little
        when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML document</i
      >
    </p>
    <h4>Heading Tags:</h4>
    <p>
      HTMl provides you with six tags, from &lt;H1&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;to
      &lt;H6&gt;&lt;/H6&gt; to help you create different sized headers quickly
    </p>
    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png" />
    <h4>Inserting an Image:</h4>
    <p>
      All that's good, but what fun without images on the webpages? Don't worry,
      &lt;IMG/&gt; to the rescue!The image tag has a mandatory attribute called
      "source".Basically,it tells the browser where it should look for the
      image. The syntax goes something like:
    </p>

    &lt;img sre = "path_to_your_image"/&gt;
    <p>
      Furthermore,it also has attribute like height and width that let you
      specify the height and width you want your image to take.
    </p>
    <h4>Lists:</h4>
    <p>
      HTMl has two types of lists - ordered and unordered.EAch item of your list
      has to be enclosed in a tag.The syntax for creating a list is fairly
      simple.
    </p>
    <p>Suppose you want to create a list like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following code will easily do the job for you:</p>
    <hr />
    <pre>
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This,by the way, was an example of an unordered list.For an ordered
      list,all you need ot do is replace &lt;ul&gt; with &lt;ol&gt; and
      &lt;/ul&gt;with &lt;/ol&gt;
    </p>
    <p>Let's see what the following code does:</p>
    <hr />
    <pre>
        &lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
             &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;I am unordered list's item 1! &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;I am unordered list's item 2! &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;I am unordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;I am unordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;/ul&gt; 
             &lt;ol&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;I am ordered list's item 1! &lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;I am ordered list's item 2! &lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;I am ordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;I am ordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ol&gt; 
          &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
        
    </pre>
    <hr />

    <p>
      All of these tags,when arranged coherently, will provide you with a simple
      webpage consisting of images,headings, and lsts.Further, there are various
      tags that HTML supports, and we thoroughly recommend you to check them out
      and play with them!
    </p>
    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      You now know enough to skim through and understand any part of an HTML
      code. We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the source code
      of any website(you 'll find some tags you don't know,but that's how you
      learn!).Oh , and welcome to the world of ewb development. With HTML under
      your belt, your next stop should be making your page beautiful using CSS.
